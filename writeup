Done


Q3. Where in the STM memory map are the three ELF segments placed (i.e. flash, sram, system memory)?

Part 2: 4

Q4. What role does the startup file (startup_stm32f10x_md.s) play?

Q5. Can you get the red LED to flash? Why is this harder? This is a good example of some of the challenges you will face with embedded devices and why the reference manual/STM-examples are key.
